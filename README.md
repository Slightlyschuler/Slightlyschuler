- 👋 Hi, I’m @Slightlyschuler
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and data sciences. The classes I have taken have given me a little bit of insight in to how developers and data analysts work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and studying for my mathematics degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that I may be able to help on and any that will teach me new things.
- 📫 How to reach me ...email: slightlyschuler@hotmail.com
